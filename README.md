Welcome to the repository for the project "Application of the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Food Security Classification in West Sumatra Province". This Data Science Statistics Final Project is dedicated to providing deeper insights into the food security conditions in the region.

Why Is This Project Important?
This research utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) Algorithm to accurately classify food security levels in West Sumatra Province. By analyzing crucial variables such as availability, accessibility, utilization, composite value, and the Food Security Index (IKP), we can identify areas that are most vulnerable or most resilient in terms of food security.

Achievements and Benefits
Our K-NN model, with an n_neighbors value of 3, demonstrates strong predictive performance, evidenced by an MAE of approximately 0.03747 and an RMSE of approximately 0.05072. This accuracy confirms that K-NN is a reliable tool for analyzing food security data. Hopefully, the results of this project can serve as a strong foundation for policymakers and researchers to formulate more targeted and effective intervention strategies in efforts to improve food security in West Sumatra.
